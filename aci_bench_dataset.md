# METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION
****************************

1. **Methods of Data Collection**:
	The ACI-BENCH dataset was created through a structured process:

    - virtassist and virtscribe subsets were developed by medical experts (doctors, scribes, etc.) based on real-world encounters, with human transcriptions and ASR outputs.

    - The aci subset involved role-played doctor-patient conversations using symptom prompts, with ASR transcripts and notes generated by an automated system, then refined by medical experts.

    - All subsets were carefully annotated and validated to ensure accuracy and realism for benchmarking clinical note generation.

# SUMMARY OF DATA FILES
************************

1. **List of data files**
	ðŸ“Œ **_metadata.csv**
	-  Metadata files include columns for the dataset name (e.g. virtassist, virtscribe, aci), id, encounter_id, doctor_name,
    patient_firstname, patient_familyname, gender, chiefcomplaint (cc), and secondary complaints(2nd_complaints). Both
    id and encounter_id can be used to identify a unique encounter.

	ðŸ“Œ **transcript/note file (*.csv)**
	- transcript and note text are given along with the dataset name and id or encounter_id. This file
    may be joined with the metadata files using either id or encounter_id.

ðŸ“Œ **Variable list**:
    - dataset : string
    - encounter_id : string
    - dialogue : string
    - note : string
