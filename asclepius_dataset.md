# METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION
****************************

1. **Methods of Data Collection**
	The dataset is structured in a Clinical Note - Question - Answer format, designed to train and evaluate clinical large language models (LLMs). The data collection process involved two key steps:

   - Synthesis of Synthetic Clinical Notes:
        Synthetic clinical notes were generated using GPT-3.5, based on case reports from PMC-Patients (PubMed Central Patient Case Reports). This step ensured the creation of realistic and diverse clinical narratives.

   - Generation of Instruction-Answer Pairs:
        Using the synthetic clinical notes, 157,000 instruction-answer pairs were generated. These pairs were created to simulate real-world clinical questions and answers



ðŸ“Œ **Variable list**:
    - patient-is : integer
    - note : string
    - question : string
    - answer : string
    - task : string    


    > **_NOTE:_**: the task column is normalized to 8 labels:
       1. Question answering
       2. Abbreviation expansion
       3. Relation extraction
       4. Named Entity recognition
       5. Summarization
       6. Temporal information extraction
       7. Coreference resolution
       8. paraphrasing
