# METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION
****************************

1. **Methods of Data Collection**:
	The MTS-DIALOG dataset was created by generating simulated doctor-patient conversations from publicly available clinical notes. These clinical notes were sourced from the [Mtsamples collection](https://www.mtsamples.com/), a public repository of de-identified medical notes (South et al., 2014; Moramarco et al., 2022a). The selected notes cover the six most frequent note types and specialties in the collection, including:
        - General Medicine
        - SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
        - Neurology
        - Orthopedic
        - Dermatology
        - Allergy/Immunology

2. **Quality assurance procedures**:
	The quality of the MTS-DIALOG dataset is ensured through a three-stage process:
        **Annotator Selection**: Only candidates with medical training (e.g., former medical scribes) were hired as annotators.
        **Training and Feedback**: Annotators received one-on-one periodic feedback during the initial stages from an experienced trainer.
        **Independent Validation**: The entire dataset was independently validated using a rubric grading system to ensure accuracy and consistency
